# Hate Speech/Profanity Detection Project

### The Problem:

Social media has become a vital part of our modern society, from political elections to fashion and education,
social media like Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, and Meta have truly become all-encompassing. However for many of the great benefits that social media
provides there are some terrible consequences. Cyberbullying, racism/hate speech, and profanity run rampant.
Social media has become like the wild wild west, with law-less entities wantonly posting content without concern or
care for others.

### The Solution:

As much as we would like to prevent the future of George Orwell's big brother from ever becoming reality we must accept
the fact that freedom of speech/expression can lead to dark places. Thus, technologies must be created to limit
hate speech, cyberbullying, and harassment in spaces where it does not belong. Training a machine
learning algorithm I was able to detect the presence of hate speech and profanity in tweets containing text.
Leveraging the power of Natural Langauge Processing (NLP) I was able to train a model to detect hate speech with an
accuracy of 78% and to detect profanity with an accuracy of (percentage)%.

### The implementation:
#### Keep safe spaces safe!

Monitor social medias/online forums and censor hate speech and profanity in real-time. Adjust custom thresholds
depending on your use case. For example, allowing profanity to exist in adult oriented content and limiting 
it altogether in spaces primarily used by children. 

### Future Work

Create a Reddit/twitch bot that can censor hate speech in real-time. Replace hate-speech/ profanity with an
auto-generated summary of the text (to convey meaning without negative sentiment)
